## Custom Node Files

### [nodes.py](https://github.com/jhj0517/ComfyUI-CustomNodes-Template/tree/master/nodes.py)
This file is where your actual custom node classes are defined. The class has specific methods that are called by the ComfyUI engine.
There're some basic custom nodes for the example with some comments, you can modify them as you need.
For detailed information on how to create custom nodes, please refer to the ComfyUI official documentation: 
- https://docs.comfy.org/essentials/custom_node_walkthrough.

### [__init__.py](https://github.com/jhj0517/ComfyUI-CustomNodes-Template/tree/master/__init__.py)
You can map your custom node display names here. It will be used when users search for your custom node in the ComfyUI.

### [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/jhj0517/ComfyUI-CustomNodes-Template/tree/master/pyproject.toml)
This file is used to publish your custom node to the ComfyUI registry. If you want to publish your custom node to the ComfyUI registry, you need to modify this file.

If you wonder what ComfyUI registry is, please read:

- https://docs.comfy.org/registry/overview#why-use-the-registry

### [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jhj0517/ComfyUI-CustomNodes-Template/tree/master/requirements.txt)
This file contains the dependencies needed for your custom node. `torch` is already installed in the ComfyUI, so you only need to add "extra" dependencies here.

## Github Actions

### [publish-comfyui-registry.yml](https://github.com/jhj0517/ComfyUI-CustomNodes-Template/tree/master/.github/workflows/publish-comfyui-registry.yml)
When you push into the `master` branch, this workflow will be triggered and publish your custom node to the ComfyUI registry, using your [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/jhj0517/ComfyUI-CustomNodes-Template/tree/master/pyproject.toml).
You have to register your "REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN" in the Github Action Secrets which you can get from:
- https://docs.comfy.org/registry/publishing#create-an-api-key-for-publishing

After generating the repository from this template, uncomment the branches to enable the workflow with auto trigger:
